- **Seasonal Patches:** Quarterly (overhauls, new mechanics)

**Data-Driven Balancing:**
- Monitor faction win rates (aim for 30-36% each)
- Identify overperforming and underperforming strategies
- Analyze player complaints and feedback (but don't react to every opinion)
- Playtest proposed changes internally before deploying

**Communication:**
- Transparent patch notes (explain reasoning, show data when possible)
- Beta balance server for testing changes (community volunteers)
- Post-patch retrospectives (did the changes work?)

**Example Patch Notes:**
```
### Balance Patch 1.2.3 - March 2026

**Yahud:**
- Temple Guardian armor: 50 → 55 (Yahud had lowest win rate at 28%, Temple Guardians underused)
- Covenant Shield cost: 100 → 120 Faith (overused in high-level play, reduced interactivity)

**Kristan:**
- Missionary conversion rate: 15% → 18% per turn (Kristan struggling in early game conversions)

**Issam:**
- Mujahedeen movement: 4 → 3 tiles/turn (too mobile, difficult to counter)
- Madrasa cost: 150 Wood → 120 Wood (underbuilt, want to encourage scholar strategies)

**General:**
- Food consumption during sieges increased by 20% (sieges lasted too long, stalling games)
```

- **CDN:** CloudFront for asset delivery

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Horizontal scaling for stateless services (API, matchmaking)
- Database read replicas for query distribution

  - CPU > 70% for 5 minutes → scale up
  - CPU < 30% for 15 minutes → scale down

**Cost Monitoring:**
- Set budget alerts (AWS Budget)
- Optimize instance types (reserved instances for baseline load)
- Regular cost reviews (identify waste, over-provisioned resources)

**Estimated Monthly Costs (10K CCU):**
- Compute: $3K-$6K
- Database: $2K-$4K
- Cache: $1K-$2K
- Storage & CDN: $500-$1K
- Monitoring & Misc: $500-$1K
