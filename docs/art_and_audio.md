# Art & Audio Direction

**Theme:** "Illuminated Manuscript meets Realistic Grit."

1.  **Atmospheric Realism:** Avoid cartoonish proportions. Use realistic textures for stone, sand, and cloth. Lighting should reflect the harsh sun of the desert or the gloom of a storm.
2.  **UI as Artifact:** The interface should look like parchment, leather, and hammered metal. Tooltips look like marginalia in a book.
3.  **Color Palettes:**
    - _Yahud:_ Deep Blues, Gold, Sandstone.
    - _Kristan:_ Crimsons, Iron Grey, White.
    - _Issam:_ Emerald Greens, Turquoise, Geometric patterns.
