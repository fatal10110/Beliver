# Economy & Resource Design

## 1. Core Philosophy

The economy of _Sons of Abrim_ is designed to create tension between **Physical Survival** (Food/Materials) and **Spiritual Dominance** (Faith). Players cannot maximize both easily; they must balance feeding the body vs. feeding the soul.

## 2. Primary Resources

### A. Faith (The Strategic Resource)

- **Source:** Temples, Shrines, Devout Population, Relics.
- **Sink:** Casting Spells, Upgrading Religious Tiers, Converting Neighbors, Diplomatic Actions.
- **Cap:** Soft cap based on Temple infrastructure.
- **Dynamics:** Generated per turn. Penalized by "Sinful" actions (breaking alliances, cruelty).

### B. Food (The Survival Resource)

- **Source:** Farms, Fishing, Trade.
- **Sink:** Population upkeep, Troop maintenance.
- **Dynamics:** Famine leads to a drop in Devotion (Faith generation multiplier). Surplus allows population growth.

### C. Materials (Wood/Stone/Iron)

- **Source:** Logging Camps, Mines, Quarries.
- **Sink:** Building construction, Fortifications, Weaponry.
- **Dynamics:** Finite local resources encourage expansion or trade.

## 3. The Devotion Meter (Meta-Currency)

- **Definition:** A global modifier representing the populace's loyalty and religious fervor.
- **Scale:** 0% (Heretical/Rebellious) to 100% (Zealous).
- **Effects:**
  - **High Devotion:** Bonus Faith generation, troop morale buff, resistance to enemy conversion.
  - **Low Devotion:** Reduced production, chance of riots, vulnerability to enemy spies.

## 4. Economic Flow & Loops

### The Growth Loop

1.  Build Houses -> Increase Population.
2.  Population consumes Food -> Requires Farms.
3.  Population generates Faith (if happy) -> Allows Temple Upgrades.

### The War Loop

1.  Spend Materials to build Barracks.
2.  Spend Food to maintain Army.
3.  Spend Faith to buff Army (Blessings).
4.  Conquer Territory -> Gain new resource nodes -> Risk Devotion drop due to war weariness.

## 5. Trade Systems

- **Internal Trade:** Moving food from fertile provinces to arid mining colonies.
- **External Trade (Diplomacy):**
  - _Caravans:_ High risk/high reward. Can be raided.
  - _Agreements:_ "Food for Stone" contracts.
  - _Faith Export:_ Sending missionaries (trade route variant) generates Faith but angers rival leaders.

## 6. Monetization Integration

- **Accelerators:** Players can use "Royal Decrees" (premium currency item) to instantly finish a building.
  - _Constraint:_ Cannot be used on Troop training or Movement to prevent tactical P2W.
- **Resource Boosts:** 24-hour +10% production tokens (available in Season Pass).
