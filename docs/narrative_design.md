# Narrative Design & Lore

## 1. The Mythos

**Premise:** The Patriarch Abrim received the Truth, but his three sons heard it differently. Now, generations later, the "Sons of Abrim" fight not just for land, but for the definition of Truth itself.

### The Three Interpretations

1.  **The First Son (Yahud):** "The Law is Eternal." God is a strict judge. We must separate ourselves to remain pure.
2.  **The Middle Son (Kristan):** "Love is the Law." God is a father. We must bring everyone into the fold, by force if necessary, to save their souls.
3.  **The Youngest Son (Issam):** "Submission is Peace." God is the absolute ruler. Order and discipline bring us closer to the divine.

## 2. Quest Structure

Quests in _Sons of Abrim_ serve as the tutorial and the mid-game guidance system.

### Types of Quests

- **Divine Mandates (Main Story):** "Build the Great Temple," "Unite the 3 Provinces."
- **Prophecies (Dynamic Events):** "A famine is coming. Store 500 Food or face rebellion."
- **Parables (Moral Dilemmas):**
  - _Scenario:_ A neighboring village asks for aid but follows a different faith.
  - _Choice A:_ Send Aid (+Diplomacy, -Food).
  - _Choice B:_ Refuse (+Food, +Devotion from hardliners).
  - _Choice C:_ Demand Conversion (+Faith, Risk of War).

## 3. Flavor Text & World Building

- **Item Descriptions:** Should contain snippets of scripture from the respective faction's holy book.
  - _Sword of the Faithful:_ "Steel sharpens steel, as brother sharpens brother." - Book of Issam 4:2.
- **Loading Screens:** Historical anecdotes about the Age of Abrim.

## 4. Campaign Arcs

### Arc 1: The Shattering

- Tutorial campaign. The player starts as a minor lord right after the death of the last unifier. Focuses on basic mechanics.

### Arc 2: The Crusade of Thorns

- Focuses on the Kristan faction's expansion. Heavy combat focus.

### Arc 3: The Golden Sands

- Focuses on the Issam faction's scientific and cultural boom. Economic focus.

### Arc 4: The Keeper's Oath

- Focuses on the Yahud faction's defense against overwhelming odds. Survival focus.

## 5. Tone

Solemn, Epic, Tragic. The tragedy is that all three factions want peace, but their mutually exclusive truths make war inevitable.
