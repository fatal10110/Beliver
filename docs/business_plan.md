# Business & Production Plan: Sons of Abrim

## 1. Executive Summary

_Sons of Abrim_ is a turn-based online strategy game leveraging a unique "Abrahamic-inspired" low-fantasy setting. It targets the intersection of hardcore strategy gamers and players interested in historical/religious lore. The business model relies on a sustainable Free-to-Play (F2P) approach with cosmetic and convenience-based monetization.

## 2. Market Analysis & Target Audience

### Primary Audience

- **Demographics:** Adults (18-45), predominantly male.
- **Interests:** History, Theology, Grand Strategy (Civilization, Crusader Kings), Board Games.
- **Psychographics:** Valuing depth, moral complexity, and long-term planning over twitch reflexes.

### Secondary Audience

- **Mobile Strategy Gamers:** Players of Clash of Clans or Rise of Kingdoms looking for less "arcade" and more "depth."
- **Roleplayers:** Players drawn to the narrative of lineage and faith.

## 3. Monetization Strategy

The game will utilize a **"Fair F2P"** model to ensure competitive integrity while maximizing LTV (Lifetime Value).

### Revenue Streams

1.  **Cosmetic Microtransactions (The "Vanity" Layer):**
    - Temple Skins (e.g., Gothic, Byzantine, Moorish styles).
    - Unit Heraldry and Banners.
    - Leader Portraits and Voice Packs.
2.  **Battle/Season Pass (The "Engagement" Layer):**
    - Seasonal themes based on religious festivals or historical eras.
    - Rewards: Exclusive cosmetics, minor resource caches (non-breaking), currency.
3.  **Convenience/Time-Savers (The "Patience" Layer):**
    - Speed-ups for construction (capped to prevent "Whale" dominance).
    - Queue expansion slots.
4.  **Premium Content (The "Lore" Layer):**
    - Story Campaigns: Single-player scenarios exploring the life of Abrim or specific saints.

## 4. Production Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pre-Production (Months 1-3)

- Finalize GDD (Game Design Document).
- Concept art for 3 factions.
- Tech prototype: Asynchronous turn backend.

### Phase 2: Vertical Slice (Months 4-9)

- Playable core loop: Build -> Gather -> Train -> Move.
- One faction fully playable (e.g., Kristan).
- Basic UI implementation.

### Phase 3: Alpha Production (Months 10-18)

### Phase 4: Beta & Soft Launch (Months 19-24)

## 5. Risk Assessment

- **Risk:** Religious controversy.
  - _Mitigation:_ Ensure lore is distinct enough from real-world religions (names, specific rituals) while keeping the thematic essence. Use "Fantasy Counterparts."
- **Risk:** Pay-to-Win perception.
  - _Mitigation:_ Strict limits on time-savers; no buying "Faith" or combat stats directly.
