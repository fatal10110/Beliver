# Narrative Design & Lore

## 1. Core Mythos
**The Central Conflict**: All three factions descend from **Abrim the Wise**, who received a "Truth" from the Divine. His three sons interpreted this Truth differently, leading to an eternal schism.

### The Interpretations
1.  **Yahud (First Son)**: *Law & Purity*. God is a judge. The Covenant must be kept strict and pure. "The Law is Eternal."
2.  **Kristan (Middle Son)**: *Love & Redemption*. God is a father. The message is for everyone. "Love is the Law."
3.  **Issam (Youngest Son)**: *Submission & Order*. God is the absolute ruler. Discipline brings peace. "Submission is Peace."

### Player Framing
*   **User as Prophet**: The player writes Scripture that guides the faction leader.
*   **AI as King**: The agent interprets doctrine and acts in the world.

## 2. Campaign Structure
The story is delivered through acts (Seasons) or campaign chapters.

### Arc 1: The Shattering
*   **Theme**: Introduction to the conflict.
*   **Plot**: The last "Unifier King" dies. The three lieutenants (leaders of factions) break the peace treaty to claim the throne.
*   **Tutorial**: Takes the player through basic management (the village) -> expansion (the province) -> war (the clash).

### Arc 2: The Crusade of Thorns
*   **Focus**: Kristan aggression.
*   **Plot**: A charismatic Kristan leader declares a holy war to "cleanse" the heathen lands.
*   **Mechanic**: Introduces large-scale "Crusade" mechanics (allies joining wars).

## 3. Quest Design
Dynamic quests guide the player and provide flavor.

*   **Divine Mandates**: Main story tasks (e.g., "Build the Great Temple"). Reward: rare artifacts.
*   **Parables (Dilemmas)**:
    *   *Event*: A plague hits a rival city.
    *   *Choice A*: Send aid (gain diplomacy, lose food).
    *   *Choice B*: Blockade (gain security, lose reputation).
    *   *Choice C*: Preach (send missionaries to convert the desperate).

## 4. Tone
**Solemn, Epic, Tragic.**
The tragedy is that all three factions genuinely believe they are saving the world, but their incompatible truths make peace impossible.
