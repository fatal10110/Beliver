# Narrative Design & Lore

## 1. Core Mythos
**The Central Conflict**: All three factions descend from **Abrim the Wise**, who received a "Truth" from the Divine. However, his three sons interpreted this Truth differently, leading to an eternal schism.

### The Interpretations
1.  **Yahud (First Son)**: *Law & Purity*. God is a judge. The Covenant must be kept strict and pure. "The Law is Eternal."
2.  **Kristan (Middle Son)**: *Love & Redemption*. God is a father. The message is for everyone. "Love is the Law."
3.  **Issam (Youngest Son)**: *Submission & Order*. God is the absolute ruler. Discipline brings peace. "Submission is Peace."

## 2. Campaign Structure
The story is delivered through acts (Seasons) or Campaign chapters.

### Arc 1: The Shattering
*   **Theme**: Introduction to the conflict.
*   **Plot**: The last "Unifier King" dies. The three lieutenants (Leaders of factions) break the peace treaty to claim the throne.
*   **Tutorial**: Takes the player through basic management (The village) -> Expansion (The province) -> War (The clash).

### Arc 2: The Crusade of Thorns
*   **Focus**: Kristan aggression.
*   **Plot**: A charismatic Kristan leader declares a holy war to "cleanse" the heathen lands.
*   **Mechanic**: Introduces large-scale "Crusade" mechanics (allies joining wars).

## 3. Quest Design
Dynamic quests guide the player and provide flavor.

*   **Divine Mandates**: Main story tasks (e.g., "Build the Great Temple"). Reward: Rare Artifacts.
*   **Parables (Dilemmas)**:
    *   *Event*: A plague hits a rival city.
    *   *Choice A*: Send Aid (Gain Diplomacy, Lose Food).
    *   *Choice B*: Blockade (Gain Security, Lose Rep).
    *   *Choice C*: Preach (Send Missionaries to convert the desperate).

## 4. Tone
**Solemn, Epic, Tragic.**
The tragedy is that all three factions genuinely believe they are saving the world, but their incompatible truths make peace impossible.
