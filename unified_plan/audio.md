# Audio Direction

## 1. Music Strategy
**Genre**: Orchestral / World / Choral.
**Vibe**: Historic, Spiritual, Grand.

### Dynamic Mixing
The music changes based on the game phase:
*   **Revelation (Editing/Compile)**: Sparse choir pads, subtle drones, page turns.
*   **Peace/Economy**: Soft wind instruments (duduk, flute), gentle strings (oud, lute).
*   **War/Combat**: Heavy percussion (war drums), brass swells, intense choral chanting.

### Faction Themes
*   **Yahud**: Somber cello & violin, ancient shofar blasts.
*   **Kristan**: Gregorian chants, church bells, pipe organ undertones.
*   **Issam**: Oud melodies, intricate percussion rhythms, call-to-prayer style vocals (instrumental).

## 2. Sound Effects (SFX)
**Immersion is key.**
*   **UI**: Parchment crinkling, heavy stone blocks sliding, coins clinking.
*   **Doctrine Editor**: Quill scratches, seal stamps, low "resonance" on compile.
*   **Map**: Wind howling across dunes, distant city bustle, birds near oases.
*   **Combat**:
    *   *Steel on Steel*: Sharp, ringing.
    *   *Arrows*: Whoosh + Thud.
    *   *Magic*: Ethereal, bass-heavy rumbles.

## 3. Voice Over
*   **Narrator**: A grave, elderly storyteller (Abrim's Ghost) guiding the player.
*   **Unit Barks**: Short lines in English (or stylized pseudo-language).
    *   "Thy will be done."
    *   "For the Covenant!"
    *   "We march."
