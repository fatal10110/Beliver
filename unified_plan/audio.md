# Audio Direction

## 1. Music Strategy
**Genre**: Orchestral / World / Choral.
**Vibe**: Historic, Spiritual, Grand.

### Dynamic Mixing
The music changes based on the game state:
*   **Peace/Economy**: Soft wind instruments (Duduk, Flute), gentle strings (Oud, Lute). Relaxing.
*   **War/Combat**: Heavy percussion (War Drums), brass swells, intense choral chanting.

### Faction Themes
*   **Yahud**: Somber Cello & Violin, Ancient Shofar blasts.
*   **Kristan**: Gregorian Chants, Church Bells, Pipe Organ undertones.
*   **Issam**: Oud melodies, intricate percussion rhythms, Call to Prayer style vocals (instrumental).

## 2. Sound Effects (SFX)
**Immersion is key.**
*   **UI**: Parchment crinkling, heavy stone blocks sliding, coins clinking (satisfying weight).
*   **Map**: Wind howling across dunes, distant city bustle, birds near oases.
*   **Combat**:
    *   *Steel on Steel*: Sharp, ringing.
    *   *Arrows*: Whoosh + Thud.
    *   *Magic*: Ethereal, bass-heavy rumbles (divine power).

## 3. Voice Over
*   **Narrator**: A grave, elderly storyteller (Abrim's Ghost?) guiding the player.
*   **Unit Barks**: Short lines in English (or stylized pseudo-language).
    *   "Thy will be done."
    *   "For the Covenant!"
    *   "We march."
