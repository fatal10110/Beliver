# Game Design Document: Sons of Abrim

## 1. High-Level Concept
**Sons of Abrim** is a turn-based online strategy game set in a low-fantasy world closely mirroring real-world medieval culture and religious conflicts. The narrative centers on three faiths, each descending from the same patriarch—Abrim the Wise—yet bitterly divided over whose lineage is truly “chosen.”

> "Manage resources, expand territory, and convert or conquer opponents using unique religious spells, diplomacy, or military might."

## 2. Core Narrative & Lore
*   **The Patriarch**: Abrim the Wise, founder who received divine guidance.
