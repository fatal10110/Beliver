*   **Single Faction Slice** (one faction, limited units/resources).

## Phase 1: MVP (Trial Mode) (Weeks 5-12)
*   **Compiler Service** (LLM-backed) with schema validation, banned content, and memetic-hazard sanitization.

*   **Fog of War** and deterministic diplomacy (enumerated offer vocabulary).
