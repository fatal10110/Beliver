# Business & Economy Plan

## 1. Monetization Model
**Strategy**: Free-to-Play (F2P) with fair, cosmetic-focused monetization. No "Pay-to-Win".

### Revenue Streams
1.  **Battle Pass (Seasons)**:
    *   **Free Track**: Basic cosmetics, small resource bundles (catch-up only).
    *   **Premium Track**: Exclusive temple skins, unit armor sets, leader portraits, animated emotes.
2.  **Cosmetic Store**:
    *   Temple Skins (Gothic, Byzantine, Moorish styles).
    *   Unit Banners and Emblems.
    *   Environmental Decorations.
3.  **Expansions (Potential)**:
    *   New single-player campaigns or historical scenarios.

## 2. In-Game Economy Design

### Resource Flow
*   **Sources**:
    *   **Faith**: Temples, Relics, Devout Population.
    *   **Food**: Farms, Oases, Trade Routes.
    *   **Materials**: Forests, Mines, Quarries.
*   **Sinks**:
    *   **Construction**: Buildings cost Materials.
    *   **Maintenance**: Army upkeep costs Food/Gold.
    *   **Spells**: Powerful miracles cost large amounts of Faith.
    *   **Diplomacy**: Trade agreements and tributes.

### Trade System
*   **Route Mechanics**: Automatic resource exchange between allied/neutral cities connected by roads.
*   **Interdependence**: Scarcity designed into map generation to force trade (e.g., Yahud starts near stone but lacks wood; Issam has spices/gold but lacks food).

## 3. Operations & Live Service
*   **Seasons (3-Month Cycle)**:
    *   New narrative event ("The Great Schism", "Age of Prophets").
    *   Leaderboard reset.
    *   Balance patches.
*   **Community Events**:
    *   Global goals (e.g., "Generate 1B Faith collectively") to unlock free rewards.
