## Prompt for GameBuildr AI

**Project Title**: _Sons of Abrim: A Turn-Based Faith & Conquest Strategy Game_

### 1. High-Level Concept

> A turn-based online strategy game set in a low-fantasy world closely mirroring real-world medieval culture and religious conflicts. The narrative centers on three faiths, each descending from the same patriarch—Abrim the Wise—yet bitterly divided over whose lineage is truly “chosen.” Players must build and protect their realm, manage resources, grow population, spread faith, and engage in diplomacy or war, all while balancing moral and political consequences.

### 2. Core Narrative & Lore

1. **The Patriarch: Abrim the Wise**
   - Revered founder who received divine guidance about the One True God.
   - His teachings were recorded on sacred scrolls, though they’re interpreted differently by each of his three sons.

2. **Three Brothers & Their Faiths**
   1. **Yahud** – _The Covenant of the First Son_
      - Parallels Judaism.
      - Believes in upholding Abrim’s “original covenant” with strict laws and traditional rituals.
      - Holy texts revolve around preserving the father’s earliest teachings with near-literal devotion.

   2. **Kristan** – _The Promise of the Middle Son_
      - Parallels Christianity.
      - Proclaims a new covenant—fulfilling (yet transcending) the old one—centered on universal love and redemption.
      - Emphasizes spreading the “good word” and missionary activity to invite all nations under Abrim’s grace.

   3. **Issam** – _The Revelation of the Youngest Son_
      - Parallels Islam.
      - Claims to have received the final, uncorrupted word of Abrim, clarifying prior faiths.
      - Organized around daily prayers, a legal-ethical code, and strict monotheism.

3. **World Setting**
   - **Semi-Realistic Geography**: Middle Eastern-inspired deserts, Mediterranean-like coasts, and fertile farmland.
   - **Sacred Cities**: Each son’s faith has a holy city tied to episodes in Abrim’s life, fueling rival pilgrimages and disputes.
   - **Atmospheric Realism**: Architecture, clothing, and social structures echo real-world medieval societies.

### 3. Gameplay Mechanics

1. **Turn-Based Strategy & Progression**
   - Players take actions (build, recruit, cast spells, move troops, trade) within discrete turns.
   - Allows for asynchronous multiplayer—each turn completes after a set time or once all players finalize their moves.

2. **Faith & Devotion**
   - **Primary Resource**: “Faith,” generated by devout populations and holy structures (temples, shrines).
   - **Devotion Meter**: Tracks how strongly your population believes in you. Positive events (festivals, victories, moral acts) boost devotion; scandals or cruelty diminish it.

3. **Secondary Resources**
   - **Food**: Feeds population and troops, ensuring stability. Famine decreases devotion.
   - **Wood (and other Materials)**: Builds and upgrades structures. Scarcity can stifle expansion and lead to unrest.

4. **Population & Generations**
   - **Family Systems**: Households grow over time, contributing to workforce and Faith generation.
   - **Population Happiness**: Influenced by availability of food, safety from raids, and religious satisfaction.

5. **Religious Structures & Spells**
   - **Temples / Holy Sites**: Central to each brother’s faith, boosting Faith production and granting unique faction benefits.
   - **Spells / Blessings**: Reflect each faith’s doctrine:
     - _Yahud_: Protective wards, “fire from the sky,” or local “purification” rituals.
     - _Kristan_: Healing miracles, moral boosts for allies, or “holy retribution” on enemies.
     - _Issam_: Plagues (curses), “divine guidance” to quickly mobilize troops, or morale buffs rooted in final revelation.

6. **Territorial Control & Conversion**
   - **Religion Spread**: Build minor shrines in neutral or enemy villages, send missionaries, or sponsor religious events to encourage conversions.
   - **Military Conquest**: Warfare can force submission, though forcibly conquered populations have low devotion and risk rebellion.

7. **Diplomacy & Alliances**
   - **Same-Faith Alliances**: Cohesive alliances with shared doctrines.
   - **Interfaith Tensions**: Negotiations possible but complicated by deep-rooted doctrinal conflicts.
   - **Intrigue**: Betrayals, espionage (sowing seeds of doubt in rival populations), or forging uneasy truces under external threats.

### 4. Economics & Resource Flow

1. **Faith Economy**
   - Spend Faith on spells, advanced temple upgrades, religious festivals.
   - High devotion yields big returns, but negative events or resource shortages slash Faith generation.

2. **Building & Maintenance**
   - **Temples** scale in cost but increase Faith.
   - **Farms** increase Food supply, require upgrades for efficiency.
   - **Houses** expand population capacity.
   - **Fortifications** protect from invasions.

3. **Trading & Aid**
   - Open trade routes with allies for Food, Wood, or specialty goods.
   - Player actions—like sending famine relief—boost diplomatic ties and sometimes religious influence.

### 5. Monetization Model

1. **Free-to-Play with Optional Microtransactions**
   - **Cosmetic Upgrades** (e.g., unique temple skins, decorative banners, special armor sets).
   - **Time-Savers** (limited, so it doesn’t become pay-to-win).
   - **Premium Content**: Additional story campaigns, unique lore expansions (like side-quests about legendary saints or prophets).

2. **Battle/Season Pass**
   - Rewards players with cosmetics, minor resource bundles, or specialized ornaments for shrines/temples as they progress.

### 6. Target Audience

1. **Age Range & Interests**
   - Adults (18+) interested in faith-based storytelling, medieval history, or deep strategic gameplay.

2. **Player Types**
   - **History/Religious Lore Enthusiasts**: Appreciate the parallels to real-world Abrahamic faiths.
   - **City-Builder & Strategy Fans**: Love resource management, fortifications, conquest, and alliance-building.
   - **Roleplayers**: Engage deeply with moral choices and faction identity.

### 7. Emotional & Moral Depth

- **Sibling Rivalry & Beliefs**: The central dramatic hook is that each brother is fully convinced he is Abrim’s beloved heir. This fuels genuine conflict and player-driven stories about loyalty, tolerance, aggression, or reconciliation.
- **Realistic Consequences**: War weariness, famine, and religious fervor can drastically change how populations perceive their leader. Ethical dilemmas encourage players to reflect on the interplay of faith, power, and morality.

### 8. Visual & Artistic Direction

- **Medieval Middle Eastern / Mediterranean Aesthetics**
- **Religious Iconography** based on each faction’s interpretation of Abrim’s teachings (scrolls, chalices, star-and-crescent motifs, etc.).
- **Solemn, Grand Soundtrack** that evokes a spiritual and historical atmosphere.

### 9. Key Differentiators

1. **Strong Religious Lore** with parallels to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—each deeply explored and integral to gameplay.
2. **Generational Progression** that invests players emotionally in the growth of their population and the lineage of followers.
3. **Turn-Based Online Multiplayer** that balances deep strategic depth with more casual scheduling.
4. **Diplomatic & Moral Systems** encouraging cooperative alliances, trade, and potential interfaith dialogue or conflict.

### 10. Summary Statement

> “**Sons of Abrim** is a turn-based MMO-strategy game where players immerse themselves in the saga of three rival faiths, each tracing its lineage to a single patriarch. Manage resources, expand territory, and convert or conquer opponents using unique religious spells, diplomacy, or military might. Develop your people’s devotion through thoughtful leadership and moral choices—will you unify the faithful under a banner of peace, or enforce your claim as the ‘true heir’ through fire and steel?”
