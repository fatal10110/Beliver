# Content (Narrative, Art, Audio)

## Narrative & Worldbuilding

- Define “Abrim” canon:
  - timeline of key events
  - sacred cities and their significance
  - faction doctrines and points of dispute
- Tone: low-fantasy medieval realism with moral consequence.
- Player fantasy:
  - ruler + spiritual leader tension
  - unity vs. conquest arcs

## Factions (Content Deliverables)

- For each faction:
  - visual language (architecture, banners, motifs)
  - unit roster identity and silhouettes
  - temple/shrine styles and upgrade visuals
  - miracle/spell VFX themes
  - diplomacy voice and narrative hooks

## Holy Sites & Map Content

- Design holy sites:
  - unique rules and bonuses
  - pilgrimage/seasonal events
  - conflict drivers that don’t force constant war
- Biomes: desert, coast, fertile plains; POIs to support trade and choke points.

## Event & Quest Content

- Systemic events:
  - famine relief, disputes, scandals, heresies, pilgrimages, external invaders
- Short narrative questlines:
  - teach mechanics while reinforcing faction identity
  - branching choices that affect devotion and diplomacy

## Art Production

- Concept art:
  - faction mood boards, key characters, architecture sets
- 3D/2D pipeline (depending on engine):
  - modular building kits
  - unit sets + animations
  - UI kit (icons for resources, devotion states, miracles)
- VFX:
  - miracles/blessings/curses readability and performance budgets

## Audio

- Music pillars: solemn/grand, regionally inspired without direct copying.
- SFX sets: UI, city ambience, combat, miracles.
- VO needs (if any): narrator, faction callouts, tutorial guide.

## Localization & Accessibility

- Localization plan (languages, cultural review).
- Accessibility:
  - colorblind-safe overlays for faction territories
  - readable combat reports

## Sensitivity & Safety Review

- Establish review gates:
  - naming and symbols
  - depiction of rituals and holy sites
  - narrative text and in-game chat policies
- Community moderation for religious/political harassment (tools + staffing).
