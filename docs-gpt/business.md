# Business

## Product Definition

- **Genre / positioning**: asynchronous turn-based online strategy + city builder + faction identity.
- **Platforms**: decide early (PC + mobile? web?); impacts scope, UI, and monetization constraints.
- **Audience & rating**: target adults (18+). Confirm desired regional availability and ratings targets.
- **USP**: faith/devotion as a first-class resource + moral consequences + multi-faction diplomacy.

## Market & Validation

- Competitive scan (asynchronous strategy, 4X-lite, city builder, MMO-strategy).
- Player research: what “turn-based online” means to your audience (session length, cadence).
- Prototype validation:
  - fun of the turn loop
  - clarity of devotion/faith system
  - diplomacy utility vs. “always war”

## Monetization & Pricing Strategy

- Choose model and guardrails:
  - F2P cosmetics + limited time-savers (strict anti-pay-to-win policy)
  - season/battle pass (cosmetic-first, “minor resource bundles” capped)
  - premium expansions (new regions/campaigns/faction subtrees)
- Economy governance:
  - define “competitive integrity” rules (what can never be sold)
  - spending caps / diminishing returns for time-savers
  - transparent odds (avoid lootbox patterns unless you can comply everywhere)

## Legal, Compliance, and Risk

- **Religious parallels**:
  - consult sensitivity reviewers early (names, symbols, depictions, language)
  - establish content guidelines and escalation process
- Regional compliance:
  - privacy (GDPR/CCPA), age-gating, parental controls if under-18 permitted
  - platform policies (App Store/Google Play) if mobile
  - payments, refunds, taxes/VAT, chargebacks
- Community safety:
  - code of conduct
  - moderation tools and staffing plan
  - reporting/appeals workflow

## Community & Live Ops

- Soft-launch plan (one region / limited invite) to test retention, economy, and server load.
- Seasonal cadence:
  - season length, resets (if any), rewards, content drops
  - event toolkit (server-driven configs) to avoid frequent client updates
- Support ops:
  - help center, ticketing, ban tooling, incident response runbooks

## Metrics & Analytics

- Define success metrics per phase:
  - prototype: fun/clarity
  - alpha: D1/D7 retention, session frequency, turn completion rate
  - beta: conversion, ARPPU (if applicable), churn reasons, economy inflation
- Instrumentation plan:
  - events for turns, combat outcomes, devotion changes, purchases
  - dashboards and alerting (spend anomalies, exploit indicators)

## Funding & Resourcing

- Budget scenarios (lean vs. full production) and runway planning.
- Outsourcing plan (art, audio, QA, localization) + vendor management.
