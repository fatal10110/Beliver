**Overall Status**: 🏗️ **Phase 1: Foundation (In Progress)**

This document tracks the high-level completion status of the project. It must be updated whenever a significant implementation step is completed.

---

## 1. Foundation & Infrastructure
*   **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
*   **Progress**:
    *   [x] **Monorepo Setup**: Turborepo, pnpm/npm workspaces configured.
    *   [x] **App Scaffolding**: `apps/server` (NestJS) and `apps/client` (Vite+React) created.
    *   [x] **Shared Packages**: `packages/shared-types` linked and building.
    *   [x] **Infrastructure**: `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres/Redis) created.
    *   [x] **CI/Build**: `turbo build` verified green.

## 2. Backend Implementation (Platform + Simulation)
*   **Status**: 🟡 **PENDING (Phase 1)**
*   **Phases**:
    *   [ ] **Phase 1: Platform Skeleton** (Gateways, DB, Auth)
    *   [ ] **Phase 2: Simulation Service** (Hex Math, Game Loop, Policy Executor)
    *   [ ] **Phase 3: Platform Services** (Matchmaking, Policy Storage, Oracle Feed)

## 3. Frontend Implementation
*   **Status**: 🟡 **PENDING (Phase 1)**
*   **Phases**:
    *   [ ] **Phase 1: Visual Foundation** (Toggle Layout, Babylon Setup, Hex Grid)
    *   [ ] **Phase 2: Gameplay Interaction** (Playback, Inspector, Decision Trace)
    *   [ ] **Phase 3: Integration** (Socket Connection, State Sync)

## 4. AI & Agents (Compiler + Oracle)
*   **Status**: ⚪ **NOT STARTED**
*   **Phases**:
    *   [ ] **Phase 1: Mock Agent** (Regex/Stub)
    *   [ ] **Phase 2: Scripture Compiler** (LLM Pipeline, Policy Schema)

## Recent Updates
*   **2026-01-31**: Initialized Monorepo Foundation. Apps and Shared Packages are building.
*   **2026-01-31**: Updated `concept.md` & Production Plan with Deterministic Diplomacy, Complexity Budget, and Agent Persona Review (Round 7).
*   **2026-01-31**: Implemented Backend Database Layer (Prisma + Postgres) & Initial Persistence Service.
*   **2026-01-31**: Aligned Production Plan to hybrid services (Platform + Simulation + Compiler) and doctrine-first loop.
*   **2026-01-31**: Added Simulation + Compiler stubs, shared schemas, and docker-compose services for local dev.
*   **2026-01-31**: Added Phase 0 doctrine editor layout, debug UI scaffolding, and expanded shared types for doctrine policy contracts.
*   **2026-01-31**: Implemented Phase 0 compiler stub, deterministic client simulation, and trial run UI plumbing.
*   **2026-01-31**: Added Phase 0 hex-grid visual map preview plus VP breakdown and deterministic turn log panels.
*   **2026-01-31**: Added Phase 0 single-faction content data (Abrim, units, buildings) and wired sim costs/yields to it.
*   **2026-01-31**: Fixed client dev import of `shared-types` by aliasing the source module for Vite/TS.
*   **2026-01-31**: Added Babylon-based GameScene with orthographic camera and thin-instanced hex grid, plus Phase 1 visual foundation checklist updates.
*   **2026-01-31**: Added game-engine scaffold entrypoint and forced external linking for simulation dev to avoid macOS LC_UUID errors.
*   **2026-01-31**: Removed invalid `@babylonjs/react` dependency and aligned Phase 1 dependency list to installed packages.

## Technical Debt & Constraints
*   **Prisma Generation**: Client is generated to `src/generated/client` instead of `node_modules`. This is a workaround for Monorepo/NestJS build issues. Long-term fix required.
*   **Game State Typing**: The `Game` entity uses `Json` type. Phase 2 implementations must cast this to `IGameState` (from shared-types) at the service boundary.
